# Python tool for querying NOAA Institutional Repository (IR) JSON API

Once files are downloaded, tool provides a menu to view or individual collections as well as download all items from IR. All packages used within the files are builtins, with the exception of requests.

## Usage

Download api_query.py and menu.py and place in the same. Run the following in shell:

```python menu.py ```

If there is no issue, you should be greeted with the following:

```
 Query NOAA Resposistory JSON REST API

    1. Get CSV of collection
    2. Get CSV of all items
    3. Quit

```

Or, you can simply use ```api_query.py``` on its own.
